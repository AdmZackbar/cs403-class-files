The SEA Programming Language
Written by Zach Wassynger for CS 403 - Programming Languages

Building:
Simply run the command 'make' in this directory to build the 'interpreter' executable.

Usage:
To find the exact schematics for writing code in the SEA language, check 'grammar.txt' in the grammar subdirectory.
In essence, at the top level SEA is made up of classes, with a main function appended at the end. The grammar is very similar to C, with a few additions, absences, and tweaks.
To run your program, build the 'interpreter' executable, then either call that, or use the 'run' shell script in this directory. Example: ./interpreter <yourfile.sea> <args>
