The SEA programming language

SEA is a dynamically typed, object-oriented language that is built on top of C.
Though syntactically similar to C on some levels, it is also quite different in many aspects, particularly with respect to structure.
Each .sea file is comprised of classes, which are built up from base level objects.
The classes themselves are comprised of variables and functions, which behave similarly to those found in C.
A difference worth noting is that variables are now general and are invoked with 'var'.
Access modifiers are now used to denote scope for functions and variables.
